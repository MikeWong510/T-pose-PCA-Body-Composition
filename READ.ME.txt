***These are the instructions to using the T-pose model for body composition estimates. 
***Must send request for shape model to johnshep@hawaii.edu. Shape model is too large to be saved on Github.

1. Repose your Fit3D meshes using Meshcapade GmbH (cost is 5 Euros per scan). Contact https://meshcapade.com/ for help.
	a. pose: T
	b. up axis: +Y
	c. look axis: +z
	d. resolution: high
	e. units: meters
	f. hands: splay

2. Once you have the T-pose mesh, open the R script.
3. Set your working directory (your mesh needs to be in the working directory), load the PCA model, and run the script.
4. Total fat mass should have added to your dataframe.
5. To get other whole-body and regional body composition indices, follow the equations published in
